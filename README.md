# D3-Choropleth-Map 
Data Visualization Projects - Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map Project.

## Overview

This project involves creating a choropleth map that visualizes data across different counties. The map will include various features to enhance user interaction and data representation.

## User Stories

1. **User Story #1**: My choropleth map should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.
2. **User Story #2**: My choropleth map should have a description element with a corresponding `id="description"`.
3. **User Story #3**: My choropleth map should have counties with a corresponding `class="county"` that represent the data.
4. **User Story #4**: There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the counties.
5. **User Story #5**: My counties should each have `data-fips` and `data-education` properties containing their corresponding FIPS and education values.
6. **User Story #6**: My choropleth map should have a county for each provided data point.
7. **User Story #7**: The counties should have `data-fips` and `data-education` values that match the sample data.
8. **User Story #8**: My choropleth should have a legend with a corresponding `id="legend"`.
9. **User Story #9**: There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the legend.
10. **User Story #10**: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.
11. **User Story #11**: My tooltip should have a `data-education` property that corresponds to the `data-education` of the active area.
